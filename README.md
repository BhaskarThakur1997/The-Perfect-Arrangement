# The-Perfect-Arrangement

Write a query to print the id, first_name and last name. To filter the names, concatenate the first and last names to create a combined name. Return the names of customers whose combined names are less than 12 letters long. Sort the results by their combined name lengths, then alphabetically, case insensitive, by combined name, then by id. All sorts are ascending.
